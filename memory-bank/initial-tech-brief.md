# Initial Tech Brief: Axian Business Processor

## 1. Project Overview

The Axian Business Processor is a cloud-native application designed to handle asynchronous business data processing. It is built on a microservices-oriented architecture using AWS services, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security. The core of the system is an F# service that processes messages from an SQS queue, performing validation and executing business logic.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to create a robust and decoupled system for processing business transactions. By leveraging a message queue, the system can handle variable loads, retry failed transactions, and ensure that no data is lost, even if downstream services are temporarily unavailable.

## 3. Key Components

- **`BusinessProcessor`**: An F# service that acts as the central message consumer and processor.
- **`AWS SQS`**: The message queue that decouples the message producers from the `BusinessProcessor`.
- **`CloudFormation`**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated and repeatable deployments.
- **`Docker`**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **`LogAggregator`**: A centralized logging service for monitoring and debugging.
