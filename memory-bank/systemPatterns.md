# System Design Patterns

This document outlines the key architectural and design patterns employed in the Axian Business Processor project.

## 1. Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: The system is decomposed into small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. This promotes scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of components.

- **Message-Driven Architecture**: The core of the system is built around asynchronous message passing using AWS SQS. This decouples services, improves fault tolerance, and allows for effective load balancing and throttling.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: AWS resources are managed using CloudFormation templates. This ensures that the infrastructure is versioned, repeatable, and can be deployed consistently across different environments.

## 2. Security Patterns

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: All incoming data is validated to prevent common security vulnerabilities. This includes verifying user identity and validating message content.

- **Resilient Message Handling**: To prevent data loss, messages are explicitly deleted from the SQS queue only after they have been successfully processed. This ensures that failed transactions can be retried or investigated.

- **Structured Error Logging**: The system uses structured logging to differentiate between different types of errors (e.g., deserialization vs. validation). This is particularly important for identifying and handling "poison pill" messages.

## 3. Deployment Patterns

- **Containerization**: All applications are containerized using Docker. This creates a consistent and isolated environment for development, testing, and production, reducing the risk of environment-specific issues.
